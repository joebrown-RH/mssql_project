# Ansible Collection: automatesql.mssql

This collection provides a suite of powerful Ansible roles for the complete, automated lifecycle management of Microsoft SQL Server on Windows. It is designed to be idempotent, flexible, and scalable, handling everything from initial installation to ongoing maintenance like patching.

This collection will grow over time to include more roles for comprehensive SQL Server administration.

## Example Playbooks

Here are basic examples of how to use the roles in this collection.

### Example 1: Install a New SQL Server Instance

This playbook uses the `sql_install` role to deploy a new, standalone SQL Server instance.

```yaml
---
- name: Install SQL Server using the sql_install role
  hosts: sqlservers
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Import the sql_install role
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: automatesql.mssql.sql_install
```

### Example 2: Patch a SQL Server Availability Group

This playbook uses the `sql_ag_patch` role to apply updates to an existing Availability Group.

```yaml
---
- name: Patch SQL Server Availability Group
  hosts: sqlservers
  gather_facts: true

  vars:
    ag_name: "My-AG"
    desired_sql_version: "15.0.4223.1"

    sql_patch_source: "//FileServer/SQL_Updates/"
    sql_patch_filename: "SQLServer2019-KB5011644-x64.exe"
    sql_patch_checksum: "a1b2c3d4..." # Replace with actual checksum
    
  
  tasks:

      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: automatesql.mssql.sql_ag_patch  
```
### Example 3: Install SqlServer and SqlServerDsc PowerShell Modules
